# Code Quiz 

Created by me: *Danielle Hillman*

## This quiz allows the user to answer a multiple choice questions under the pressure of a timer. 

The timer starts at 90 and if the user answers a question wrong, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. A correct question will increase the user's score.

## Main Points 

This program utlizes functions and event.listeners to iterate over the questions depending on what answer the user chooses. 


## Scoreboard
After the user has completed the quiz, a input form allows them to store the username and score to local storage to then be ranked.

## Future Updating
In the future more questions can be added since they are itterated through with a function.
